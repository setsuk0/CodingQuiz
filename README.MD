# Javascript Timed Quiz

## Description

For module 4, we created a coding-related quiz. I had a number of issues with this. I originally had a repo where this quiz worked and was deployed on github pages. However, it appeared as though I deleted all my files at some point between completing the assignment and submitting it. I had to redo the assignment. This time I had issues with my high score page not working.
